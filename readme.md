# Mid-term Project: Signals and Systems (Python)

## Description
This project shows how to generate and manipulate simple signals using Python and NumPy  
It is designed for a **mid-term evaluation** in a Signals and Systems course

The code includes:
- Functions to generate signals (sine)
- Example script to plot and save results

## Project structure
.
├── signals.py # Functions for signals
├── script.py # Example script
├── README.md # Documentation
└── pyproject.toml

## Functions
### Signal generation
- **create_sine_wave()**: creates a sampled sine wave  

### Utility
- **plot_signal()**: plots one or more signals and saves the figure

## How to run
1. Install Python and the required packages:
''pip install numpy matplotlib''
2. Run the script:
'' python script.py ''
